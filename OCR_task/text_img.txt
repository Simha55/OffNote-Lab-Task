FALLING TOO FAST TO PREPARE FOR THIS

TRIPPING IN THE WORLD COULD BE DANGEROUS

EVERYBODY WAITING FOR THE FALL OF MAN

EVERYBODY HOPING THEY COULD BE THE ONE

WHIP, WHIP
RUN ME LIKE A RACE HORSE

I WANNA BE THE SLIP, SLIP

LETTER THAT YOU RIP, RIP


‘CAUSE I LOVE THE ADRENALINE IN MY VEINS

‘CAUSE I LOVE HOW IT FEELS
WHEN I BREAK THE CHAINS

WHATEVER IT TAKES

YOU TAKE ME TO THE TOP

YOU TAKE ME TO THE TOP
