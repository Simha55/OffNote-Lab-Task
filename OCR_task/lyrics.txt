Imagine Dragons — Whatever

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Hold me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
| wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Hold me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
| wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes

Cause | love the adrenaline in my veins

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top I'm ready for

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
| was born to run, | was born for this

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half diseased
And when | am deceased
At least | go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
| do what it takes
